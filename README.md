## Experience Tetris like never before in VR. Shape, move, conquer the wall for endless immersive fun!

InsideTetris transforms defined walls into a Tetris board, allowing players to manipulate Tetris pieces using hand tracking. Players must strategically place the pieces while also engaging in fitness activities like boxing, utilizing hand tracking for puzzle placement. The dynamic gameplay adapts to any wall shape defined by the player, ensuring optimal gameplay by avoiding real-world obstructions and maximizing gaming space.

I implemented gameplay mechanics using Oculus Fast-Hands sample such as left and right movement by fist gestures, rotation upon stop gesture, and downward movement by slice gestures. The scoring system awards points for each piece placed and additional points for completing lines scored similar to normal Tetris game, ensuring a fair scoring mechanism that considers the size of the walls. Points are also saved in azure and the application shows the top ten high scores.
